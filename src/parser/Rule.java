 * Represent a rewrite rule.
 * A rule contains a preExpr which contains a list of Symbols that are going to be replaced, and a postExpr that contains
 * the replacing symbols: preExpr -> postExpr.
 * <p>Each rule has a probability to happen if it is in conflict with another (for non determinist grammars)</p>
 * <p>The rules are divided in 2 groups:
 * <ul>
 * <li>simple rules are those which only have one symbol in preExpr</li>
 * <li>complex rules are those which have more than one symbol in preExpr</li>
 * </ul>
